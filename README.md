# 🚀 Frontend Monorepo with Shared UI (Turborepo)

A modern **frontend monorepo** setup built using **Turborepo**, where multiple frontend applications share a **single reusable UI component library**.  
This project demonstrates **real-world frontend architecture**, scalability, and clean UI practices.

---

## ✨ Project Overview

This monorepo contains two independent frontend applications:

- **Marketing App** – Public-facing landing page  
- **Dashboard App** – Internal admin-style application  

Both applications **share a common UI package**, proving how reusable components can be managed efficiently in a large-scale frontend system.

> 💡 The goal of this project is to showcase **industry-level frontend architecture**, not just UI.

## 🧩 Shared UI Package

The **UI package** contains reusable components used across both apps.

### Example:
- `Button` component  
- Same styling, same behavior  
- Used in **Marketing** and **Dashboard** without duplication

This ensures:
- Consistent UI
- Faster development
- Easier maintenance

---

## 🖥️ Applications

### 🌐 Marketing App

## ⚡ Why Monorepo?

This setup reflects how **real companies** structure frontend systems.

### Benefits:
- Code reusability
- Single source of truth for UI
- Faster builds with Turborepo caching
- Clean separation of concerns
- Easy scalability

> Marketing and Dashboard are **separate apps**, not separate files — exactly how production systems work.
